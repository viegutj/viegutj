# Software Engineer

In contrast to our current world of “iPad Babies”, I grew up in a (self-coined) era of “Gameboy Babies”. My journey in technology started when I was three years old and my brother gave me his hand-me-down Gameboy Color with a game cartridge of Pokemon Crystal. I was so fascinated that I kept playing and playing, though I couldn’t yet read, until I could understand the text of the game I was playing. From this young age, I have loved exploring fantastic software experiences. As a teen, this took the form of modifying components of my PC, coding basic scripts on my Raspberry Pi, and exploring tools such as emulation. These technology explorations taught me curiosity, quick learning, and self-teaching, all of which I use daily with teams and clients as a software engineer. As a professional, my goal is to make the experience of software as seamless, engaging, and immersive as my first experiences were on the Gameboy Color.

In addition to my passion for software, I have a love for music that grew throughout high school and college, leading me to be a public school band teacher. I learned how to break down concepts for students, which has helped in my communication, problem solving, and self-teaching. I also learned how to interact with students, parents, and administration in a way that made everyone feel heard, valid, and valued. However, I realized quickly that education was not an environment where I would thrive professionally. I left with a clear vision of my ideal professional life: intellectually challenging problems that keep me growing on a daily basis, with a positive culture and ambitious team.

After speaking with my fiance about her experience as a UX designer, I pivoted from music to the possibility of a technology position. The promise of the job matched exactly with my vision: challenge with growth, positive culture, and ambitious teams.  Her coworkers recommended pursuing the Full Stack Engineering Program at Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis, which taught me how to learn software technologies quickly, and prepared me for the current software engineering world. I am passionate about learning and grateful to have found an industry that fosters it.
