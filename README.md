### Jonathan Viegut
# Software Engineer

In contrast to our current world of “iPad Babies”, I grew up in a (self-coined) era of “Gameboy Babies”. My journey in technology started when I was three years old and my brother gave me his hand-me-down Gameboy Color with a game cartridge of Pokemon Crystal. I was so fascinated that I kept playing and playing, though I couldn’t yet read, until I could understand the text of the game I was playing. From this young age, I have loved exploring fantastic software experiences. As a teen, this took the form of modifying components of my PC, coding basic scripts on my Raspberry Pi, and exploring tools such as emulation. These technology explorations taught me curiosity, quick learning, and self-teaching, all of which I use daily with teams and clients as a software engineer. As a professional, my goal is to make the experience of software as seamless, engaging, and immersive as my first experiences were on the Gameboy Color.

My vision of my ideal professional life: intellectually challenging problems that keep me growing on a daily basis, with a positive culture and ambitious team. Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis taught me how to learn software technologies quickly, and prepared me for the current software engineering world. I am passionate about learning and grateful to have found an industry that fosters it.
